# Computer Science Free-Play Lab Rubric

This lab is designed as a **showcase project** for Parents Day.  
Students are encouraged to create any program they’d like that ties in concepts we have learned so far this year.  
Your project does **not** need to use every concept — choose the ones that best fit your idea.  

---

## Project Expectations
Your program should:
- Be functional and runnable.  
- Incorporate Python concepts we have studied (at least some of the following):  
  - Data types and variables  
  - Functions and loop logic  
  - Classes and objects  
  - Imports (built-in modules, third-party modules, or self-written ones)  
  - File I/O (especially JSON read/write)  
  - Flask apps or API usage (optional, but encouraged if it fits)  
- Be something you are excited to share with parents.

## Rubric (10 points total)

| Category | Excellent (Full Credit) | Satisfactory (Partial Credit) | Needs Improvement |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Functionality (3 pts)** | Program runs smoothly with clear, complete functionality. | Program runs with minor errors or missing features. | Program does not run or is incomplete. |
| **Use of Concepts (3 pts)** | Effectively integrates Python concepts (e.g., functions, loops, imports, JSON, Flask). | Uses some concepts, but integration is limited or inconsistent. | Minimal or no use of relevant course concepts. |
| **Creativity & Originality (2 pts)** | Project idea is creative, engaging, and clearly personalized. | Project shows some creativity but follows a standard idea. | Project shows little creativity or is copied from examples. |

## Total Score: ___ / 10

### Teacher Notes:
- Students should feel free to **experiment and play** — this is a chance to demonstrate ownership of learning.  
- A simple but well-executed idea can still earn full credit.  
- Creativity and clarity matter as much as technical complexity.
