# Details For Wednesday, 9/24

## Project Expectations 

### Group Check-in (Standup Meeting)
1. Communicate with group for a briefing of where each member is at in their progress.
2. Meeting is not meant to take long. It should be short enough where you can 'stand up' through the meeting.

### Github
1. At least one additional commit with source code progress. Basically all progress towards program itself.

2. Update read me with progress for each day...
   * Name, date, and details of what work was done from each member.
   * Updates to file structure should be reflected in readme.
   * Any public API's should be directly linked
