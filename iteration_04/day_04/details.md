# Parent's Day Lab Prep Workshop

Today’s class is a workshop day to get your projects ready for Parent’s Day tomorrow.  
We’ll begin with a short **stand-up meeting** so every group can share their progress and plans.

---

## 1. Stand-Up Meeting

Each group will briefly answer these questions (about 2 minutes per group):

1. **Progress** – What did we complete or improve last time we worked?
2. **Next Steps** – What is our focus for today?
3. **Obstacles** – What’s blocking us? What help do we need?
4. **Testing & Feedback** – How will we make sure this works when parents arrive?

---

## 2. Workshop Goals

After the stand-up, use the remaining class time to:

- Debug or polish features in your project
- Finalize instructions for parents
- Assign demo roles:
  - Who will **explain the project** to parents?
  - Who will **click/drive** the program?
  - Who will **help troubleshoot** if needed?
- Write a quick README or one-slide “project card” to display with your project

## 3. Parent’s Day Prep

Be ready to share:

- A **1–2 sentence elevator pitch** that explains your program clearly to parents
- A working version of your project that is easy to demo
- A plan for what happens if something breaks during demo

---

### Remember:
Keep the stand-up short and focused.  
The rest of today is about making sure you’re confident and ready for tomorrow’s showcase!
